Decibel Meter Web App
A simple web application that measures sound levels in decibels using the microphone and Web Audio API. Built with HTML, JavaScript, and Tailwind CSS.
Features

Real-time decibel measurement from microphone input.
Simple user interface with start/stop functionality.
Hosted on GitHub Pages for easy access.

Prerequisites

A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.).
A microphone connected to your device.
Git and a GitHub account for hosting.

Setup Instructions

Clone or Download the Repository:
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd <repository-name>


Test Locally:

Open index.html in a web browser to test the app locally.
Ensure your browser has permission to access the microphone.


Deploy to GitHub Pages:

Push the project to a GitHub repository:
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git push origin main


Go to your repository on GitHub.

Navigate to Settings > Pages.

Set the Source to Deploy from a branch, select the main branch, and choose the / (root) folder.

Save the settings. GitHub Pages will provide a URL (e.g., https://<username>.github.io/<repository-name>).

Wait a few minutes for the site to deploy, then access it via the provided URL.




Usage

Open the deployed URL in a browser.
Click the Start button to begin measuring sound levels.
Allow microphone access when prompted.
The decibel level will display in real-time.
Click Stop to end the measurement.

Notes

The decibel calculation is an approximation based on the RMS of the audio signal, not a calibrated measurement.
Ensure your microphone is enabled and not blocked by browser or system settings.
For accurate results, use in a controlled environment.
